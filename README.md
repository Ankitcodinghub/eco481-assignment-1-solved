1 Exercise 1

1. Your friend Albert builds a classification algorithm on the following data. It has 10,000 features and 100 observations. As the newest machine learning expert in your group of friends, he decided to ask you for help. (10 points)

Clearly explain to Albert what his model is likely to suffer from.

In fact, Albert has implemented the model and finds an accuracy rate of 99% on the training sample. Unfortunately, when it evaluates the model on a new dataset (the test sample), you have 50% accuracy. Explain to Albert what it means to have 50% accuracy.

Suggest a step you would take to fix the problem Albert is having.

After correcting the problem, you get two models. First, you use logistic regression and get an error rate of 10% on training data and 15% on test data. Then we use the 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. K=1) and get an average error rate (simple average over test and training datasets) of 9%. Based on these results, what method would you recommend to Albert for his classification exercise? Clearly explain why.

2. For each decision boundary, explain which classifier between the logistic regression and

KNN is likely to have generated it. (5 points)

Panel A Panel B

4. You have a set of three data points with only one predictor and an output: x1 = 4 and y1 = 1, x2 = ‚àí2 and y2 = 0, x3 = 1 and y3 = 1. Suppose you use it as a training sample. In a logistic regression, what will be the value of the parameter Œ≤ associated with x? Give a short explanation for your choice. (5 points)

a) Œ≤ = 1

b) Œ≤ = 0

c) Œ≤ = ‚àû

2 Exercise 2:

You work as a data analyst at Twitter. Because of all the scandals and growing fake news on social media, Twitter would like to improve its algorithm to detect fake news. As the junior analyst, you are in charge of analyzing the past ‚Äúfake news‚Äù data.

You are given the following information:

10 out of 10000 tweets are classified as fake by the current twitter algorithm.

With some human checks, we realize that 20% of the tweets classified as fake by the algorithm are not.

10% of tweets classified as ‚Äùnon fake‚Äù by the algorithm are.

2. You have a talk in front of your team. How would you summarize in a very meaningful way how well the current algorithm is performing? (show your calculation and explain your decision). (5 points)

3 Exercise 3: Application‚Ä¶ (65%)

‚ÄúMobile money (m-money) refers to the use of mobile phones to perform financial and banking functions.‚Äù (IFC Mobile Money Study 2011: Summary Report).

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mobile money users and non-users characteristics. In this application, we want to analyze the determinants of mobile money adoption using (real) data from a survey of 2,282 households in Kenya on M-PESA (‚ÄúM‚Äù for Mobile and ‚ÄúPesa‚Äù for Money in Swahili), one of the most successful mobile money applications.

1. First, you have access to the following table:

Personal ID Large household size Have a cell phone Have a mattress at home M-pesa user

1 False True False True

2 False False False False

3 False True False True

4 True False False False

5 True False True True

6 True False False False

Using the table and an entropy-based information gain, construct a decision tree (by hand, i.e make the calculus and find the relevant splits) that would predict the use of M-pesa for an individual. (NB: the logarithm to use in the entropy measurement is the logarithm to the base 2.) (15 points)

What will be the prediction generated by the tree for: ‚ÄúLarge Household‚Äù= false,

‚ÄúHave a cell phone‚Äù= False and ‚ÄúHave a mattress at home‚Äù=true.(1.5 points)

What will be the prediction generated by the tree for: ‚ÄúLarge Household‚Äù= True,

‚ÄúHave a cell phone‚Äù= True and ‚ÄúHave a mattress at home‚Äù=true.(1.5 points)

2. Now, you have access to a more complete database. Read the file ‚Äúmobile money.csv‚Äù in Python. (2 points)

3. Present descriptive statistics on the outcome variable mpesa user. Comment.(3 points)

4. Present descriptive statistics on the following variables depending on the mpesa user status. (10 points: 5 points for each label)

Own Cell Phone

Per Capita Consumption

Per Capita Food Consumption

Total Wealth

Household Size

Education of Head (Years)

Positive Shock

Negative Shock

Weather/Agricultural shock

Illness Shock

Send Remittances

Receive Remittances

Bank account

Mattress

Savings &amp; Credit Cooperative (SACCO)

Merry Go Round/ ROSCA

Farmer

Public Service

Professional Occupation

Househelp

Run a Business

Sales

In Industry

Other Occupation

Unemployed

5. Comment on the descriptive statistics‚Äô main takeaways in question 3 (no more than 3 lines).(2 points)

6. Construct the following classifiers using the outcome variable mpesa user (11 points):

Logistic Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest classifier

NB: Consider a train-test split of 80-20. Consider also standardizing the data before.

7. Comparing the accuracy rate and the area under the curve (AUC) criteria, find the best classifier among those in question 5.(6 points: 2-2-2)

8. What are the top 3 predictors based on the best classifier found in question 6? (3 points)

9. Consider now a KNN classifier. Using a loop ‚Äùfor‚Äù, consider a value of K from 1 to 10 by step of 1. In the ML jargon, we are doing a grid search. It aims to tune (find) the value of the hyperparameter ‚ÄùK‚Äù). Using cross-validation methods on the training data set, for each value of K, find the optimal value of neighbours K. (5 points)

10. Is the optimal KNN classifier, as found in question 8, outperforming the one found in 6?(2 points)

11. Based on what you have found, what is the key recommendation that you can make to a government that would like to foster the use of M-PESA among the population? (no more than 3 lines).(3 points)
